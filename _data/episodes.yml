  description: "How Books Are Made is a podcast about the art and science of making books. It's for book lovers who believe that details matter, on paper and on screen: from the feel of the paper to the shapes of the ligatures, from hyperlinks to accessibility. If you want more intriguing book-making nerdery, subscribe in your podcast player to get the next episode, and see what you think."

    In this short trailer, Arthur Attwell describes some of his favourite books, not for their content but for the way they have been physically made: an enormous production from 1902, a marketing marvel, a Wonderland ebook, and the book that nearly injured his mother to get him married.

    People who can build book brands and inspire fans are rare and amazing, even more so when they write their books, too. One of those people is Sam Beckbessinger, the bestselling author of *Manage Your Money Like a F—ing Grownup*, which is a book, a website, and a growing brand in several countries. She also writes for hugely popular kids' TV shows, and was one of the writers on Serial Box and Marvel’s serialized novel *Jessica Jones: Playing With Fire*. She is irrepressibly joyful and optimistic, which is something we all need a dose of right now.
